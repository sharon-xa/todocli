# Todo
1. Removing the last todo from a file make the program crash (DONE).
2. Sometimes adding a new todo will just stick the string into the last line (the last todo) for example "[] blah blah blah[] another todo" (DONE).
3. Try toggling a task that doesn't exists, with 0 tasks and with number of tasks (DONE).
